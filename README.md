jp - language translate for jp game

# Introduction:
As an avid fan of Princess Connect Global, I was disheartened when Crunchyroll decided to shut it down. The closure left a void in the gaming community, and as a passionate developer, I saw an opportunity to contribute something meaningful. Introducing the Japanese Game Translation App, a project aimed at reviving the beloved Princess Connect Global by bridging the language barrier and allowing players worldwide to experience the magic of the game once again.

# Motivation:
Princess Connect Global held a special place in my heart, not only as my favorite game but also as a hub for players from diverse backgrounds to connect and forge friendships. Witnessing the community's enthusiasm and commitment, I felt compelled to take action. My vision was to create a translation app that would seamlessly translate the Japanese text in the game into various languages, enabling non-Japanese speakers to navigate the world of Princess Connect Global with ease.

# Key Features:
